 * installed (see README's Testing section). These are the opposite: they load
 * `firestore.rules` into the Firestore emulator and exercise it for real,
 * because a rule can only be verified by the engine that evaluates it. That
 * means they need `firebase emulators:start` running, so they get their own
 * config and their own `yarn test:rules` script rather than making the main
 * suite depend on it.
