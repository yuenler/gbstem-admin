# gbSTEM Admin

<https://www.gbstem.org/>

## Description

> Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Innovators

Greater Boston STEM Program's website for administering the portal. It serves as the administrative interface for managing applications, registrations, classes, and users.

This website is part of the gbSTEM ecosystem. **It is primarily maintained by a rotating group of High School and college students.** Because of this, maintaining clear, readable code and robust documentation is highly prioritized.

## Frameworks and Libraries

This project relies on several key modern web technologies:

- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: The core Svelte framework used for building the site. We use SvelteKit's filesystem-based routing, server hooks, and server-side loading logic.
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**: The reactive component framework (using Svelte 5 runes) for building lightweight, highly responsive user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling and strict type-checking at any scale.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Client-side SDK used for interacting with the database (Cloud Firestore) and Firebase Authentication.
- **[Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin)**: Node.js SDK used for server-side management tasks, backend hooks, and admin-level database operations.
- **[Algolia Search](https://www.algolia.com/)**: Integrated search client (`algoliasearch`) used for indexing and searching portal entries efficiently.
- **[Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) / [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)**: Transactional email services used to send system notifications, confirmations, and reminders.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) & [Svelte Testing Tools](https://testing-library.com/)**: Our primary testing suite. We use Jest to write unit tests for utility functions and helper files.

## Getting Started with Development

### 1. Environment Configuration

Before running the development server, you must configure your local environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and adjust the placeholder values with your actual service credentials, preferably development credentials if available.

> [!WARNING]
> **Never commit your `.env.local` file or actual secrets to GitHub.** This file is configured to be ignored by Git to prevent exposing sensitive API keys and credentials. For details on how `.env` files work and how to avoid exposing credentials, read the [dotenv environment secrets guide](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#should-i-commit-my-env-file) and [GitHub's guide on ignoring files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).

### 2. Run the Development Server

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the development server
npm run dev

# start the development server and open in browser
npm start

# preview the production build locally
npm run preview

# automatically format code
npm run format

# check for type errors
npm run check

# check for type errors and watch for changes
npm run check:watch

# check for style and lint issues
npm run lint

# run unit tests
npm test

# build for production
npm run build

# build and deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result for `npm run dev` or `npm start`. You can start editing any page or component, and when running in development mode, your changes will be reflected in the browser automatically.

## Updating Dependencies

It is important to periodically update the project's dependencies to address security vulnerabilities, receive bug fixes, improve performance, and keep up with the latest features. Since this project is maintained by a rotating group of students, regular updates prevent the codebase from falling behind or becoming incompatible with modern deployment platforms.

We use the [npm-check-updates (ncu)](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) tool to check for and apply updates. Refer to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates#installation) to install it.

Once `ncu` is installed, follow this sequence of commands to update dependencies:

```bash
# Update the dependencies in package.json to the latest versions (minor/patch)
ncu -u

# Install the updated packages and update package-lock.json
npm install

# Run unit tests to verify no breaking changes were introduced
npm test

# Run type checks
npm run check

# Run lint checks to ensure code style consistency
npm run lint

# Go to http://localhost:5173 and do manual visual checks and tests

# Build the project for production to verify compatibility and compile-time checks
npm run build
```

After verifying that the tests, linting, and build pass successfully, commit and submit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the repository.

## Directory and File Index

Below is an alphabetical list of the top-level directories and significant configuration files to help you navigate the codebase:

### Directories

- **`.husky/`**: Configuration for Husky, managing Git hooks like pre-commit formatting and linting.
- **`.svelte-kit/`**: Automatically generated directory containing SvelteKit configuration, generated routes, and typings.
- **`__tests__/`**: Contains all of our Jest unit tests. Tests are organized by component/utility domain (e.g., `utils.test.ts`).
- **`node_modules/`**: Contains the project's dependencies.
- **`src/`**: The core SvelteKit application source code.
  - **`src/lib/`**: Reusable libraries, utility modules, and components:
    - **`src/lib/client/`**: Client-side specific integrations, such as clients for Firestore.
    - **`src/lib/components/`**: Reusable Svelte UI components (e.g. forms, tables, buttons).
    - **`src/lib/data/`**: Centralized static data constants, models, mock data, and TS types.
    - **`src/lib/server/`**: Server-side specific integrations, such as initializing Firebase Admin.
  - **`src/routes/`**: Handles application URL routing based on the filesystem. Subdirectories (like `applications/`, `registrations/`, `user/`) represent URL paths.
- **`static/`**: Static assets such as images and icons that can be accessed publicly by the browser.

### Files

- **`.eslintignore`**: Specifies which files and directories ESLint should ignore.
- **`.eslintrc.cjs`**: Configuration rules for ESLint, ensuring consistent code style and checking for common errors.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore (like `node_modules/` and `.svelte-kit/`).

- **`jest.config.ts`**: The configuration file for our Jest testing environment, specifically tailored to work alongside TypeScript and Svelte.
- **`jest.setup.ts`**: Initial setup code that runs before our Jest tests, importing tools like `@testing-library/jest-dom` for custom DOM matchers.
- **`package.json`**: Defines the project's details, scripts, and dependencies (the npm packages we rely on).
- **`package-lock.json`**: An automatically generated file that locks down the exact versions of dependencies used, ensuring that all developers have identical, reproducible environments.
- **`postcss.config.js`**: Configuration for PostCSS, typically used for transforming CSS with plugins.
- **`prettier.config.js`**: Configuration rules for Prettier, ensuring consistent code formatting across the project.
- **`svelte.config.js`**: SvelteKit-specific configuration (like adapter configurations and compiler options).
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration, determining design tokens like themes and spacing.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration file for compiling, bundling, and configuring build plugins.
