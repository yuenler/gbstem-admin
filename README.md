# gbSTEM Admin

<https://www.gbstem.org/>

## Description

> Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Innovators

Greater Boston STEM Program's website for administering the portal. It serves as the administrative interface for managing applications, registrations, classes, and users.

This website is part of the gbSTEM ecosystem. **It is primarily maintained by a rotating group of High School and college students.** Because of this, maintaining clear, readable code and robust documentation is highly prioritized.

## Frameworks and Libraries

This project relies on several key modern web technologies:

- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: The core Svelte framework used for building the site. We use SvelteKit's filesystem-based routing, server hooks, and server-side loading logic.
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**: The reactive component framework (using Svelte 5 runes) for building lightweight, highly responsive user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling and strict type-checking at any scale.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Client-side SDK used for interacting with the database (Cloud Firestore) and Firebase Authentication.
- **[Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin)**: Node.js SDK used for server-side management tasks, backend hooks, and admin-level database operations.
- **[Algolia Search](https://www.algolia.com/)**: Integrated search client (`algoliasearch`) used for indexing and searching portal entries efficiently.
- **[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)**: Transactional email service used to send system notifications, confirmations, and reminders.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) & [Svelte Testing Tools](https://testing-library.com/)**: Our primary testing suite. We use Jest to write unit tests for utility functions and helper files.

## Getting Started with Development

### 1. Environment Configuration

Before running the development server, you must configure your local environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create a `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and adjust the placeholder values with your actual service credentials, preferably development credentials if available.

> [!WARNING]
> **Never commit your `.env.local` file or actual secrets to GitHub.** This file is configured to be ignored by Git to prevent exposing sensitive API keys and credentials. For details on how `.env` files work and how to avoid exposing credentials, read the [dotenv environment secrets guide](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#should-i-commit-my-env-file) and [GitHub's guide on ignoring files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).

### 2. Firebase Emulator Suite (Local Development)

For local development and testing, you can use the **Firebase Emulator Suite** to run local instances of Firebase products (Firestore, Authentication, and Storage). This allows you to test application features offline without affecting production or development cloud resources.

1. Follow the official [Firebase Emulator Suite: Connect and Prototype](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype?database=Firestore) guide to set up and run the emulators on your local machine.
2. Update your `.env.local` file to point to the local emulators by uncommenting the relevant lines at the bottom of the file (see snippet below). The Firebase Admin SDK automatically routes operations to the emulators when the following environment variables are set:

   ```env
   FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="127.0.0.1:8080"
   FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST="127.0.0.1:9099"
   STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST="127.0.0.1:9199"
   ```

   Make sure the host and port values match your emulator configurations in `firebase.json`.

3. For new emulator instances, run `npm run seed` to seed the database with a demo admin user and a demo signup token.
   - Email: <demo@gbstem.org>
   - Password: `penguin`
   - Signup Token: `demo-token`

> [!WARNING]
> By default, the Firestore emulator runs in-memory. This means all seeded data and modifications are lost whenever you restart the emulator. If you want to persist the database state across restarts, start the emulator with the `--import` and `--export-on-exit` flags:
>
> ```bash
> firebase emulators:start --import=./emulator-data --export-on-exit
> ```
>
> Otherwise, you must re-run the seed script every time you restart the emulator.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the development server
npm run dev

# start the development server and open in browser
npm start

# preview the production build locally
npm run preview

# automatically format code
npm run format

# check for type errors
npm run check

# check for type errors and watch for changes
npm run check:watch

# check for style and lint issues
npm run lint

# run unit tests
npm test

# build for production
npm run build

# build and deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result for `npm run dev` or `npm start`. You can start editing any page or component, and when running in development mode, your changes will be reflected in the browser automatically.

## Updating Dependencies

It is important to periodically update the project's dependencies to address security vulnerabilities, receive bug fixes, improve performance, and keep up with the latest features. Since this project is maintained by a rotating group of students, regular updates prevent the codebase from falling behind or becoming incompatible with modern deployment platforms.

We use the [npm-check-updates (ncu)](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) tool to check for and apply updates. Refer to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates#installation) to install it.

Once `ncu` is installed, follow this sequence of commands to update dependencies:

```bash
# Update the dependencies in package.json to the latest versions (minor/patch)
ncu -u

# Install the updated packages and update package-lock.json
npm install

# Run unit tests to verify no breaking changes were introduced
npm test

# Run type checks
npm run check

# Run lint checks to ensure code style consistency
npm run lint

# Go to http://localhost:5173 and do manual visual checks and tests

# Build the project for production to verify compatibility and compile-time checks
npm run build
```

After verifying that the tests, linting, and build pass successfully, commit and submit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the repository.

## Directory and File Index
