/**
 * Prepares a document read back through `cy.getFirestoreDoc` for a
 * whole-document deep-equal against an expected shape.
 *
 * Two things have to be normalized away first:
 *
 * - `timestamps` is dropped. It holds `serverTimestamp()` sentinels, and
 *   `getFirestoreDoc`'s REST value converter has no `timestampValue` branch, so
 *   they come back as raw `{ timestampValue }` wrappers rather than dates.
 * - The arrays named in `sortArraysAt` are sorted. Svelte's `bind:group`
 *   appends in the order boxes are ticked, so a checkbox group's stored order
 *   reflects click order rather than anything meaningful - pinning it would
 *   make these tests fail for the wrong reason.
 * - The paths named in `omit` are dropped. Use this only for values that can't
 *   be compared literally - other `Date` fields, which come back as raw
 *   `{ timestampValue }` wrappers for the same reason `timestamps` does - and
 *   assert those separately. Every field dropped here is a field the
 *   deep-equal stops guarding, so keep the list short and justified.
 *
 * Deep-equal rather than per-field assertions is the point: a field added to a
 * form's schema but never wired through to the write path shows up here as an
 * unexpected default, whereas a list of `expect(data.x).to.equal(y)` lines only
 * ever checks the fields someone remembered to add.
