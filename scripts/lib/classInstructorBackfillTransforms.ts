// Pure, Firestore-connection-free transform logic for the class instructor uid
// backfill (scripts/backfill-class-instructor-uids.ts). Kept in its own module,
// with no import-time side effects, so it can be unit tested without an
// emulator/production connection.
//
// Background: a class used to record its co-instructors as
// `otherInstructorEmails`, a free-text comma-separated string the class owner
// typed by hand. firestore.rules's isInstructorOfClass() honoured that string
// directly, so typing any address at all into the class details form granted
// that person write access to the class - with no check that they were ever
// interviewed, accepted, or even a gbSTEM user. gbSTEM leadership's rule is
// that nobody teaches a class they weren't assigned and accepted for, so
// co-instructors are now stored as `otherInstructorUids` only, and a uid gets
// there only after the server confirms the account is an accepted instructor.
//
// The same "identify people by uid, not email" problem applies to the class's
// *primary* instructor: `instructorUid` was added later than `instructorEmail`,
// so classes written before it exists carry only the address, and
// firestore.rules still has to fall back to matching on it. That fallback goes
// stale the moment an instructor changes their account's email - the bug the
// uid migration exists to fix - so this backfills `instructorUid` too.
//
// This module decides what a pre-existing class document should end up with;
// the script itself does the Auth and decision lookups that can't be pure.

 * address that silently loses its access, so this errs toward recovering one.

/**
 * Recovers the owning instructor's uid from a class document's ID.

 * a class under their own uid - so for any class the portal created, the ID
 * *is* a record of who owns it, and unlike the stored email it can't go stale
 * when that person changes their address or deletes their account.
 *
 * This only strips a trailing `-<number>`; it does not try to judge whether
 * what remains looks like a uid. Firebase-generated uids are 28 alphanumeric
 * characters, but a uid set explicitly may contain anything - the seed's
 * `instructor-demo-uid` does - so a shape test would quietly fail on exactly
 * the accounts it was meant to recognise. The caller decides by asking Auth
 * whether the candidate is a real account, which is the only reliable test
 * and one it has to make anyway.
 *
 * Returns null when there is no trailing number to strip (`class-python1`),
 * since then nothing in the ID is a candidate.
