 * TEMPORARY (uid migration - see interviews.cy.ts "Section H" and
 * setInterviewTimes.ts's `isOwnInterviewSlot`): interview slots are moving
 * from identifying their interviewer by a frozen `interviewerEmail` snapshot
 * to a stable `interviewerUid`, since email goes stale if the interviewer
 * later changes their account's email. This resolves the interviewer's
 * *current* email (for the assignment confirmation email's cc/replyTo) by
 * uid when one is on file, falling back to the stored email for slots
 * written before `interviewerUid` existed.
 *
 * TODO(interviewerUid migration, remove ~2026-10-03 once the current
 * interview cycle wraps and no live slot lacks an interviewerUid): delete
 * this function and have callers use the interviewer's email straight from
 * an `adminAuth.getUser(interviewerUid)` lookup, with no fallback. Mirror
 * the same removal in portal's copy of this file.
