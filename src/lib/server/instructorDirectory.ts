 * changing their account's email doesn't leave the class carrying a stale
 * address, and so the client sending the reminder request can't dictate who
 * gets cc'd - only the server can turn a uid into an address. A uid whose
 * Auth account no longer exists is silently dropped: accounts get deleted,
 * and a reminder shouldn't bounce trying to reach one. Order follows the
 * uids passed in.
